# Location History

A toy in-memory location history server.

Supported Endpoints:

- `PUT /location/{order_id}`
- `GET /location/{order_id}?max=<N>`
- `DELETE /location/{order_id}`

Details about the endpoints:

`PUT /location/{order_id}` - append a location to the history for the specified order.
Example interaction:

```
PUT /location/def456
{
	"lat": 12.34,
	"lng": 56.78
}

200 OK
```

`GET /location/{order_id}?max=N` - Retrieve at most N items of history for the specified order. The most recent locations (in chronological order of insertion) should be returned first, if history is truncated by the `max` parameter.
Example interaction:

```
GET /location/abc123?max=2

200 OK
{
	"order_id": "abc123",
	"history": [
		{"lat": 12.34, "lng": 56.78},
		{"lat": 12.34, "lng": 56.79}
	]
}
```

The `max` query parameter may or may not be present. If it is not present, the entire history will be returned.

`DELETE /location/{order_id}` - delete history for the specified order. Example interaction:

```
DELETE /location/xyz987

200 OK
```
